## Architecture & Design Documentation

[//]: # (all architecture/design related documentation your team produced to guide the implementation)

**NOTE: This has not been tested on Windows. Everything has been verified to work using Unix G++ compilers supporting C++14.**

More in-depth documents are stored in the Documents folder. At the top level, in ProgramCoordinator, we have ExternalClient.cpp. ExternalClient is the executable which talks to the Tournament Server and spawns instances of the game. In Core/Entry-Points is where the main function for the Game instance is located. From there, TurnManager orchestrates the communication between the ExternalClient, the AI, and the BoardManager. The AI uses all of the functions provided by the BoardManager, Regions, Rules, and Board so that it can make the most accurate prediction for the highest scoring move. The BoardManager uses the Board, Tiles, Regions, and Rules to make moves, manage what is on the board, and track regions.

**TODO: Provide links here!**

## Our Client

[//]: # ( all source code necessary to build the client, detailed instructions on how to compile/build the client,detailed instructions on how to run the client,)

### Building the Client

In the root directory, simply execute:

    make

### Running the Client

After building the client, you can execute it by running:

    ./ExternalClient server-ip server-port tournament-password username user-password

To run the test server, run DaveServer in the ProgramCoordinator folder which takes a single argument which is a port to listen to. Another test server option is CmdServer, also in the ProgramCoordinator folder, which allows you to choose the responses of the other player and server.

The GameInstance file can be ignored since it is executed by the ExternalClient so that every game receives a new instance of the TigerZone game.

## Our Tests

[//]: # ( all the test [unit and acceptance code] you wrote for the client, detailed instructions on how to run the tests, & )

First, build the [Google C++ Testing Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest/) by executing the following command in the root directory:

    make gtestlib

This only has to be done once.

Each time you want to build and run the tests, simply execute the following command in the root directory:

    make tests

## Known Bugs and Issues

[//]: # (a detailed list of all the known bugs/issues needing to be addressed (if the repository system has an issue tracking system, record the issues there)

See the Issues page.
